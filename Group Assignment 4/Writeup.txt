Section 1

i) Logit yields 4 significant variables out of 41 (ignoring the constant). 
The significant ones are August kwh, December kwh, the dummy for having 3 people 
over the age of 15 in the house (420.3), and the dummy for having an immersion electric water heater (4701.2).
The dummies are not very concerning, but it is concerning that people with 
higher past consumption are more likely to be treated.

ii) The quick means also show imbalance, but they show something a little different. Below is a list of the significant variables, along with their t-stats:

kwh_2009_08    14.739744
kwh_2009_09    15.203416
kwh_2009_10    14.877134
kwh_2009_11    14.984830
kwh_2009_12    15.887552
D_410_3         5.556768
D_420_2.0       2.320252
D_420_4.0       2.983374
D_43111_2.0     3.392115
D_405_2        -6.508454
D_43521_4.0     2.419806
D_5418_2       -3.577503


In particular, the differences in consumption are significant in ALL months, whereas only two months were significant in the logit.
This is probably due to the fact that the consumption values are highly collinear.

iii) The benefit of the logit is that one can consider the imbalance of one variable, holding other variables constant. 
It's entirely likely that the groups look different on average, but look similar when you control for observables. 
This would tell us whether any selection that exists was selection on observables or unobservables.

On the other hand, by comparing means we get a sense of the that different groups look like as a whole.

iv) Questions 410, 420, and 43111 contain very similar information: namely, the age makeup of the household. In particular, 
given the answers to questions 420 (How many people over 15 years of age live in your home?) and 43111 (How many people under 15 years of age live in your home?), 
you can determine the answer to 410 (which asks whether there any children under 15 years of age in the home). I would have wanted 
to include more variables that are typically associated with consumption, like income and house size.

Also, the potential answers to 410 are not mutually exclusive, making it a bad question. The second two possible answers are 
"All people in my home are over 15 years of age" and "Both adults and children under 15 years of age live in my home". Clearly one of these must be true, but
in the data we observe about 25% of the respondents saying neither is true. It seems that these people must have opted for the other option given, "I live alone."
But then the second statement must also be true (since only adults can presumably participate in the program)! In short, this is a terrible question.

Section 3

i) The results are below. Note that the effect of interest is the effect of treatment during the treatment period, which is the captured by the coefficient 
on the treatment*trial variable. The unweighted regression shows no significant effect of this variable: a coefficient of -0.02, with a p-value of 0.12.
By contrast, the weighted regression shows a strongly significant -0.04, or a 4% reduction in electricity use attributable to the program. In both regressions, 
the seasonal dummies show higher use during the winter months, which makes sense because of higher heating demand. The coefficient on treatment is negative in
both regressions.

ii) Without weights, we would conclude (at the 5% and 10% significance level) that the program had no effect on electricity usage. Thus, a consultant to CER, 
we must conclude that this treatment had no effect.

iii) With weights, we find a strongly significant effect. Not only is the effect now signifianct, but the effect is estimated with larger precision. Hence, we 
would inform the CER that the program was effective.

iv) Since the data was biased, our estimated effect from the weighted regression depends heavily on our propensity score calculation being correct. If we had chosen
different input variables for calculating the propensity scores, we may well have gotten very different answers. Hence, the believability of the answers depends on 
how sensitive we find the results to be. One approach would be to redo these calculations using different input variables to see if the estimated effect of the treatment
changes dramatically. If it does, it would reduce our confidence in the estimate. If the results seem stable, then perhaps we are comfortable with them.
